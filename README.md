## Description
{Triangle-Track application is an application that shows the user which type of triangle is formed based on different measurements.The application has been built using html ,css and javascript.

{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}
